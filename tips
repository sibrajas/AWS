if failure with ssh, detach the volume and attach it to a working instance as a block device like /dev/sdf
lsblk shows the mounted device
mount it and edit fstab to remove all lines.
ssh configured to work only after successful mount of fstab entries.
Detach and attach it to original as root (/dev/sda1) volume to fire it back up
